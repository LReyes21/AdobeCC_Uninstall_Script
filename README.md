## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **TCC Permission Denied** | macOS privacy controls block full disk access | Pre-approve Full Disk Access via MDM (Jamf, Mosyle) or manually grant Terminal Full Disk Access in **System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Full Disk Access** |
| **App Not Found Warnings** | Some Adobe apps may not be installed on all machines | These are informational and harmless; the script skips missing apps |
| **Cleaner Tool Fails to Download** | No internet connection or Adobe URL changed | Verify internet access and update the script with the latest URL from Adobe's website if necessary |
| **Uninstaller Not Found** | CC Uninstaller is missing | Ensure the Creative Cloud Desktop app is installed, or skip this step if it has already been removed |
